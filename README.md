# wct-firebase-demo

An attempt at integrating [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com) with offline unit tests.
That is, the goal is to create an example that can verify the behavior
of code that uses firebase distributed database without actually touching
the network, keeping them isolated.

## Status

The tests currently fail. Specifically, the `offline-test.html` and `wct-firebase-demo_test.html` suites work perfectly well by putting
firebase's distributed database into offline mode.
However, the `x-element_test.html` suite fails with an API key error,
even though its lone test is practically identical to [a passing
test in `wct-firebase-demo_test.html`](https://github.com/doctor-g/wct-firebase-demo/blob/master/test/wct-firebase-demo-app/wct-firebase-demo-app_test.html#L96).


## Notes from Polymer-CLI

From here on down, it's notes generated by [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli), which may be useful
to people who haven't used it before.

### Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your application locally.

### Viewing Your Application

```
$ polymer serve
```

### Building Your Application

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with `bundled/` and `unbundled/` sub-folders
containing a bundled (Vulcanized) and unbundled builds, both run through HTML,
CSS, and JS optimizers.

You can serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve
from:

```
$ polymer serve build/bundled
```

### Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
